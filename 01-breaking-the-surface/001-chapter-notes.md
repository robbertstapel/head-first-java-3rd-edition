Java was first released on jan 23, 1996. Java is backwards compatible and because of this you will encounter older Java code in the real world.

To use Java you create a source file, compile it with JAVAC (java-compiler) and run the compiled bytecode on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). 

In a source file, put a class
In a class put methods
In a method put statements

When the JVM starts running, it looks for the class you give it at the command line. Then it starts look for a specially written method, which is the public static void main (String[] args){} method. Next, the JVM runs everything in side the curly braces {} of your main method. Every Java app has to have at least one class, and at least one main method.

In Java everything goes in a class. You'll type your source code in .java and then compile to .class. When you run thee program, you really run a class. Running a program means telling the JVM to load the given class and then start executing it's main method. Keep running till all code in main is finished.
