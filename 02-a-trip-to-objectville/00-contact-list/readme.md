### The phone's contact list analogy 
Here I have created a Contact class (the blueprint) for all your contacts in your phone.
The Contact class instantiates objects that represent the contacts in your phone.

Contact is the blueprint (Class) which we use to create objects (instances) from.
ContactTestDrive is just a helper to create (instantiate) those objects from the blueprint.
