##### A class can have any number of these
- instance variable
- method
- getters and setters
- public and private (access modifiers)

#### A method can have only one of these
- return

#### This can be implicitly promoted
- wrong: * encapsulation
- correct: return, argument

#### I prefer my instance variables private
- wrong: * class
- correct: encapsulation

#### It really means "make a copy"
- pass by value

#### Only setters should update these
- instance variable

#### A method can have many of these
- argument (it should be parameter, a method holds params, the caller provides these as arguments)

#### I return something by definition
- getter
- return

#### I shouldn't be used with instance variables
- public

#### I can have many arguments
- method (same story, params!)

#### By definition I take one argument
- setter

#### These help create encapsulation
- getter
- setter
- public * added this one
- private

#### I always fly solo
- return

## Options to pick
- instance variable
- argument
